<p><strong>&nbsp;Manifesto of Institutional Art Supremacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>[&laquo;MIAS&raquo;]</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many art movements in the past have sought to challenge institutional Art.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most of these movements have claimed against the establishment and they challenge the status quo of the Artworld.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We are not against the History of Art as it has happened, and we do not deny nor oppose the artistic movements of the past.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We are on the contrary, much in favor of the traditional Art World, as opposed to the current trends dominating the so-called cryptoart.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In our epoch, we are experiencing exceptional social changes and transformations at all levels, which generate absolute confusion about the future.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A fascinating new technique has appeared into the Artworld, relying on the blockchain technology: NFTs.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We do not consider ourselves reactionary to the novelty, nor neo-Luddites against new technologies in general, nor particularly against the blockchains and the new opportunities for the artistic expression (and commercialization) that they imply.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But we are skeptical about the kind of artistic trends which are predominant in this new field.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Blockchains (and the NFTs that are tied to them) are just a tool. Blocks can be used to build marvelous artworks, or to kidnap the Art and throw it into the deepest depths of the sea and into a period of darkness anchored with stainless chains. They can be both Pandora and her amphora. A power that is so good, but unfortunately scarce, that it inevitably generates misery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without denying its possibility as an artistic category, we consider that most of NFTs do not have any appreciable artistic value.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="11">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without denying its categorization as Art, we believe that the institutional Artworld has a relevant role to play in discriminating and separating the wheat from the chaff in the wild Metaverse that has proliferated chaotically in a decentralized way without any aesthetic criteria nor artistic criticism. Precisely, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;criticism&rsquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes from the Greek word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;kritikos&rsquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ("able to make judgments") and from </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;krinein&rsquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ("to separate, distinguish"). A shared root with the word crisis: to judge, to analyze, when something is broken, and a decision is needed. The state of chaos and uncertainty is found in Latin as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">crisis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from the Greek </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">kr&iacute;sis</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, related to the verb </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">kr&iacute;nein</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning &lsquo;to judge&rsquo; and also implying &lsquo;decision&rsquo; or &lsquo;separation&rsquo;, making its roots obvious in the Indo-European *krei-, &lsquo;to cut&rsquo; in order &lsquo;to choose&rsquo;; complemented by the suffix -sis, that commonly appears in medical terminology to indicate a condition, being applied in this case in the sense of identifying a problematic situation.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="12">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Despite a first impression of horizontality, the new channels commercializing "cryptoart" generate new hierarchies, but they govern without criteria &mdash;apart from the market power previously achieved, whatever was the cause of the success. This generates an absolute lack of real opportunities to new entrants.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="13">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The inequality in real opportunities to new participants is not something new, but at least, in the old centralized Artworld, there was a possibility of amendment and rectification, allowing the implementation of corrective measures. In this new, supposedly decentralized model of distribution, there are no technical possibilities of guaranteeing real equal access. Only money can make some artworks to bright above the rest of thousands and millions of works. So, currently, this allegedly decentralized model has the worst of the two worlds: the blindness of the chaotic and random selection (incapable of appreciating the beauty of the real Art), the demonstration of power derived from the money, and the lack of real and fair opportunities for all. And, furthermore, sometimes artworks are banned to a greater extent in decentralized marketplaces than would be in art galleries.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="14">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition, the new models of [allegedly] decentralized distribution are only partially decentralized: the way in which some collections stand out on the front pages of the portals is not transparent. Neither the collections are validated and verified (to avoid, for example, falling into scams that consist of making illegitimate reproductions of original collections) in a fair and transparent way. And almost all artworks that end up in the top of sales rankings have had to spend before a huge amount of money on advertising and marketing among specialized &ldquo;cryptoart&rdquo; influencers. Nothing new, but current influencers are absolutely 0 critical about the &ldquo;art&rdquo; they promote: there are zero art critics, but only fast tweets endorsing &ldquo;artworks&rdquo;. As Quevedo said, such a powerful gentleman is my Mister Money. This model has nothing to do with the emancipation of Humanity, but about perpetuating corruption.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="15">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without acts of curation of the art that is exposed in the main NFT marketplaces, made by experts, academics, and art professionals who have a special sensitivity and openness to changes, there will be no possible fit of this new virtual world in the History of Art.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="16">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Art which will be part of the books of Art History is the kind of Art that will prevail, and the one that will have a chance to be appreciated in the future.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="17">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For all these reasons, today an artistic and political movement is beginning, which does not intend anything other than to reconcile the great novelty, revolutionary in many ways, of NFTs and the &ldquo;cryptoart&rdquo; with the institutional Artworld.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="18">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We say yes to blockchain entering to the Art system, or more precisely, the real art entering into the blockchain, but only if it makes the humanity more free, instead of creating new chains, even stronger than the old ones (which at least could be corrupted with the rust, which allowed them to break eventually after a long time; meanwhile blockchains rest immutable &mdash;which can be a strength very appreciated, but it can also perpetuate some injustices).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="19">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A reconciliation that can only be achieved through the mutual recognition from the members of the Art system, whether they are more traditional and resulting from a certain historical trajectory (but open to change), or the totally contemporary ones (appearing out of nowhere, cryptically, thanks to this technical innovation, and as sons of the chaos of the social networks).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<ol start="20">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, February 8, 2022, is the birthday of the Institutional Art Supremacist Movement and the Institutional Art Supremacy is proclaimed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="21">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Institutional Art Supremacists believe in the need for institutions, whether private or public, commercial or academic, theoretical or practical, for the possibility of the existence of Art (in capital letters). Without institutions there is no criteria, whether confronted or in harmony, that could allow to resolve the ontological status of Art.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="22">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Supremacy of Institutional Art is not equivalent to a supremacy of traditional art, nor to a reactionary movement against NFTs. And it has even less to do with another type of racist or speciesist supremacism. On the contrary, the institutions have an important role in guaranteeing the inclusion of all the excluded and marginalized groups, something that cannot guarantee a &ldquo;kind of art&rdquo; so governed [currently] by the Market Power concentrated by few actors, without limits [other than the ones programmed by the algorithms: which can be modified].&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="23">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is not a mere symbolic declaration, but rather some first steps are taken to achieve an institutional transformation appropriate to our goals.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="24">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Steps like the constitution of the first DAO in the world of institutional art are taken. Art Galleries DAO and Art Museums DAO are founded today, in their respective founding acts.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="25">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are the first steps of many to come, which aim to build the future where Art will have the place that Humanity deserves, to cultivate and educate a postmaterialist society that needs the highest values ​​to guide its progression, and avoid the falling to the desperation and darkness, from where it&rsquo;s very difficult to escape, as the black holes of History.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="26">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cryptography and blockchain can be tools that play in favor of achieving the emancipation of the Humanity, but it will only be the case if we are capable of thinking critically about the institutions to develop in order to live together with justice and empathy, something which the blind blockchains will never offer by themselves.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="27">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Blockchains are blind, but a strong technology which can help culture and Art to escape from its way to the black hole of History. </span></li>
</ol>
