The re Aesthetics is the return
to the original hellish

1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.549
aesthetic.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.145
A new aesthetics of temperature
or ignition of septic

3
00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:08.489
aesthetics.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.189
Aesthetics, derives from the
Greek, which originally means

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.019
sensory reception, that is, the
sensation of the sensitive,

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.849
that which can be perceived by
the senses.

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.639
It is that perception of the
lowest.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.935
According to the main Greek
philosophical theories,

9
00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:28.579
especially the Platonic one,

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.619
The meaning of aesthetics has
evolved over centuries to rise

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.759
to the most intellectual and
end up being practically

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.829
equivalent to the theory of art.

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.439
And today it is an art that is
sometimes merely conceptual,

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.589
not even sensory appreciable.

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.281
Re estÃ©tica is an artistic
project that proposes the

16
00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:55.123
return to the old and original
meaning, with special emphasis

17
00:00:55.124 --> 00:00:58.965
on the perception of thermal
influence both in excess and by

18
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.807
default to reflect on the
impact that global warming

19
00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:06.649
implies for humanity, and the
most immediate threat of

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.109
Winter colder in decades due to
lack of energy in homes.

21
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.721
The return to an infernal
aesthetic is inseparable from

22
00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:15.039
the unsociable.

23
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.829
Human sociability that siakam,
like that of so many mammals

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.609
such as porcupines, which
according to the famous fable

25
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.389
are faced with the dilemma of
warming each other when it is

26
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.279
winter.

27
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.409
Even if they prick each other
because of proximity or die and

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.349
that has as a moral that you
have to learn to live with

29
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.819
small wounds.

30
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.449
That the relationship with a
very close person can cause,

31
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.759
since it stops.

32
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.669
Well, survive.

33
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.969
The most important thing is
each other's warmth.

34
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.109
How to live together?

35
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.979
That is the question.
